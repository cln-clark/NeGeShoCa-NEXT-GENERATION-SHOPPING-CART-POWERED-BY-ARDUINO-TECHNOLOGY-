# NeGeShoCa-NEXT-GENERATION-SHOPPING-CART-POWERED-BY-ARDUINO-TECHNOLOGY-
Negeshoca is our capstone project designed to create a smooth and user-friendly self-checkout system built directly into a shopping cart. It features a GM67 barcode scanner, an ESP32 microcontroller, a tablet device as the user interface, and a thermal printerâ€” all integrated into the cart itself.
